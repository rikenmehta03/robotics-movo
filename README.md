## Sim-to-real: Reinforcement Learning for robotic agent
In the field of robotics, a very powerful tool can be simulation. Simulating many years of robotic interaction is quite feasible with modern parallel computing, physics simulation, and rendering technology. The goal of this project is to develop a robust RL policy which can be transferred from simulation environment to real-world environment. Eventually generalizing such method that can be used across variety of tasks. 

### Objectives

- Re-implement already published research paper in the domain n the domain to develop necessary infrastructure around the robotics hardware that can support fast-pace research. 
- Develop robust Deep RL policies that can be trained to perform various grasping tasks in simulation, and then efficiently transferred to the real world in the few-shot settings.
- Train kinova-movo robotics platform to perform simple task like picking an object or moving an object.
- Extend the same learning method in realising complex tasks which may consists series of such simple tasks. 
- Exploring various Deep RL algorithms and trying different tasks on kinova-movo robotics platform.

I am giving more than 10hrs weekly to this project during the semester. With the help of technical expertise of Denis Yarats (1st Year PHD student) and guidance of Prof. Rob Fergus, I am expecting to complete at least first 3 objectives till the end of semester. I intend to work on this project in Summer break also.
